👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a data analyst with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights, aiming to advance into a data scientist role. 

Currently, I’m enhancing my expertise in statistics, machine learning, and programming through real-world projects at Calyx Global, where I automate data pipelines and build NLP-driven data cleaning scripts.
My Master’s in Marketing Analytics and Insights from the National University of Singapore laid the foundation for my understanding of statistical analysis, programming, and machine learning. At Calyx Global, I’ve been able to put those skills into practice by developing dashboards, streamlining data extraction with SQL queries, and creating solutions that drive key insights for the company. Before this, I worked as a Product Manager at Grab, leading e-wallet integrations and managing critical partnerships.

I’m passionate about solving complex challenges through data, continuously learning new techniques, and collaborating with others to make an impact. I’m excited about growing in the data science field and welcome opportunities to connect and share ideas.

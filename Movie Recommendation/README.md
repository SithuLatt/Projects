ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
This project focuses on building a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their favorite selections. By leveraging a dataset containing information about various movies, the system aims to provide personalized recommendations that align with user preferences.
ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The repository includes the following files and directories:
	â€¢	Data Cleaning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the data cleaning process along with detailed reasoning behind each step. This notebook ensures the data is well-prepared for building a robust recommendation system.
	â€¢	cleaned/: Folder containing the cleaned CSV files that were transformed and structured for efficient analysis and model building.
	â€¢	original_files/: Folder containing the original raw CSV files as downloaded from Kaggle. These files serve as the source data for the project.
ðŸ“ˆ Current Progress
Currently working on building the recommendation system that will take a few of the userâ€™s favorite movies as input and suggest a list of movies they might like.
ðŸ“œ Data Source
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains information on thousands of movies, including titles, genres, cast, and more.
ðŸ”§ How to Use
Once the recommendation system is complete, you will be able to:
	1	Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebooks.
	2	Input a few of your favorite movies.
	3	Get personalized movie recommendations!

I will update this README with additional instructions once the recommendation system is finalized and ready for use.

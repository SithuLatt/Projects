Python Web Scraping Project
I built a Python script using Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and Pandas to scrape data from https://bezerocarbon.com/ (before recent changes). The data was exported to CSV, cleaned in Excel, and then used to create a Power BI Dashboard for insights.

Included files are:
- The scraping script: Web Scraping.ipynb
- The cleaned export (converted to xlsx to save functions): BeZero Database (Connected to PowerBI).xlsx
- The Power BI file showing the analysis: Final BeZero Dashboard.pbix
